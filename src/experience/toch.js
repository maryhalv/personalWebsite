                            At the Township of Chapel Hill, I worked with the Technology Solutions branch to develop web applications
                            with JavaScript and Python for the public sector. Application functions included displaying
                            requests made by town residents.

                            This was my first technical internship, and I had never experienced anything like it.
                            I was thrown from my understanding of coding within the classroom into using it for real-life
                            applications. Suddenly, I found myself missing the days where a coding assignment consisted of meeting
                            20 requirements that specified everything that was expected of you. I was told to complete tasks
                            with very little guidance during this internship, and while it was frustrating at first, I learned
                            more about coding that summer than I had in a whole semester at school.
