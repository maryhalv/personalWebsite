                    During the summer of 2018, I developed an unmoderated testing tool using React and Express JavScript
                 frameworks designed to conduct remote usability testing. I worked with another software developer
                 intern to implement designs and coordinate our project tasks through agile development.

                   This internship began as such a positive experience and continues to be one. I was
                   so thankful when I was given the opportunity to become a year-round intern with SAS.
                   At SAS, my confidence in my Computer Science abilities grew immensely. I felt supported by my mentors
                   and managers, and enjoyed collaborating with others who had a similar passion for Computer Science
                   and were also glad to be at SAS.

                   I am currently continuing work on the unmoderated testing tool through refactoring and converting the class
                   components to functional components using React hooks. I have really enjoyed the opportunity
                   to refactor the complex code that I built up from scratch, because I think that is an important part of
                   improving my coding skills and I have certainly learned a great deal from it so far.
